# Project Planning

## Primary User

Anyone interested in investing in residential rental properties.

## Problem Statement

## Information Requirements

### Information Inputs

The program will require the user to input the address of the property they are considering, the purchase price, percent down, mortgage rate, and expense estimate per month (other than mortage).

### Information Outputs

The program will take the information and determine the monthly net income, first year cash on cash return, and a recommendation to buy or keep looking.

## Technology Requirements

### APIs and Web Service Requirements
